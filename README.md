## 📖 About

**QrMenu** is a Laravel-based digital menu platform designed for restaurants, cafes, and stores. It provides a clean, fast, and interactive way for businesses to display their product offerings — whether food, goods, or various other categories.  

Customers can browse menus with multiple product sizes, components, and pricing options. Orders can be quickly placed via **WhatsApp** directly from the menu. Additionally, each store can showcase their social media links, and there's even a dedicated section where customers can enjoy exciting in-menu games while waiting for their orders.
